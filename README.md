This course project is an opportunity to use what we have learned in this course and apply it in a creative, open-ended project to create something that personally interests us.

"Last semester in CSC110, we learned about the various data types provided to us by the Python programming language: 
how to write code to use them to store data, how to perform operations on them, and how to analyse the running times of many of those operations. 
In CSC111, we went beyond this by designing and implementing our own data types for representing collections of data: 
linked lists and various types of trees and, after reading week, we will look at another ADT: graphs. 
While linked lists implemented the familiar List abstract data type, trees and graphs represent fundamentally different kinds of data. 
We use trees to represent hierarchical, branching, or recursively nested data like categorizations of animals, the moves in a single-player or multi-player game, and text in human and programming languages. 
We use graphs to represent networks of data, like users and relationships on a social media platform or geographic and spatial networks."

In this project, we can choose any domain and project question, with the fundamental constraint that we must use trees and/or graphs to represent some core part of this domain.
